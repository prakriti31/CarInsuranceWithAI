## Overview

The `BonusAssignment-2.ipynb` notebook performs the following tasks:

1. **Importing Dependencies:** It imports all the required libraries such as `openai`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` for data handling, visualization, and API communication.
2. **Configuration:** It includes a section where you must add your OpenAI API key to authorize interactions with the OpenAI services.
3. **Data Preparation and Processing:** The notebook may load data, perform preprocessing tasks, or generate sample data as needed for the assignment.
4. **Interacting with the OpenAI API:** Code cells construct prompts, send them to the OpenAI API, and process the responses.
5. **Output and Visualization:** The results are displayed through print statements, logs, or visualizations (using libraries like matplotlib) to interpret the outcome of the API calls.
6. **Finalization:** The notebook concludes with summaries, cleanup tasks, and additional comments.

## File Structure

The notebook is divided into several key sections:

1. **Imports and Dependencies:**
   - Imports essential Python libraries.
   
2. **Configuration Section:**
   - Contains the cell for setting your OpenAI API key.
   
3. **Data Processing:**
   - Loads and processes any necessary data.
   
4. **OpenAI API Interaction:**
   - Constructs prompts, sends API calls, and retrieves the responses.
   
5. **Visualization and Output:**
   - Displays results through text output and visualizations.
   
6. **Conclusion:**
   - Wraps up the notebook with final comments and cleanup steps.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Imports and Dependencies:**
   - The notebook starts by importing all necessary libraries.
   - Libraries such as `openai` allow for API interactions, while `pandas` and `matplotlib` are used for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Configuration Section:**
   - In one of the early cells, you will find the configuration for the OpenAI API key.
   - It will include a placeholder like:
     ```python
     openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```
   - You must replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - The notebook loads datasets or generates data required for the assignment.
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing routines are run to prepare it for analysis and API interaction.

4. **Interacting with the OpenAI API:**
   - Prompts are built to interact with the OpenAI API.
   - The code sends these prompts to the API and processes the returned responses.
   - This section demonstrates how to create, send, and handle API requests.

5. **Output and Visualization:**
   - Results from the API calls or data analysis are printed or visualized.
   - Matplotlib is used to generate plots/charts, providing a visual representation of the data or results.

6. **Finalization:**
   - The notebook concludes with summary outputs.
   - Any final comments or cleanup routines are executed here.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:

- **Python:** Installed on your machine.
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:** To open and run the `.ipynb` file.
- **Required Libraries:** Install them using pip if needed:
  ```bash
  pip install openai pandas matplotlib

## Adding Your OpenAI API Key

Before running the notebook, follow these steps to add your OpenAI API key:

1. **Obtain an API Key:**
   - Log in to your [OpenAI account](https://openai.com) and generate an API key if you havenâ€™t already.
   
2. **Insert the API Key:**
   - Open the `BonusAssignment-2.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Locate the configuration cell that contains:
     ```python
     openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key (keeping the quotation marks).

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `BonusAssignment-2.ipynb` file and launch your preferred interface.

2. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Click on `BonusAssignment-2.ipynb` to open it.

3. **Run the Cells:**
   - Execute the cells sequentially. You can choose "Run All" from the notebook menu or run each cell individually.
   - Make sure to run the cell with your OpenAI API key configuration before executing any API calls.

4. **Monitor the Outputs:**
   - Observe printed outputs and visualizations to see the API interactions and data processing results.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Libraries:**
  - If errors indicate that certain libraries are missing, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install openai pandas matplotlib
    ```

- **Invalid API Key:**
  - Double-check that your API key is correctly entered and active, and ensure your OpenAI account has sufficient quota.

- **Data Issues:**
  - Verify that any data files or external datasets required by the notebook are available in your working directory.
